### Motivation

console.log is like REPL, that offers minimum interactive environment before execution

> NOTE: unit of code (source) must be explicitly passed to console.log(source) to be marshalled back through puppeteer instance

### Collect input from console.log to terminal of choice :

> TIP : Open DevTools on browser of choice , type in keyword `void` inside window and freely walk (Ctrl + Enter or Tab: _4 columns space for default Tab_) with cursor in a console window : once ready remove keyword void & press enter to execute or append session with global variables
